        <h2>My Philosophy</h2>
        <p>The best strategies live in decisions, behaviors, and execution—not documents.</p>
        <p>
          I don’t believe in strategy for strategy’s sake. Every framework I use is grounded in real-world constraints
          and designed to drive momentum—with clear paths to action your team can follow.
        </p>
        <p>
          I focus on finding leverage—the 20% of effort that delivers 80% of the impact. That means ruthless
          prioritization, clear ownership, and systems that make progress visible and repeatable.
        </p>

        <h2>What to Expect</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Speed:</strong> We move quickly to identify high-impact opportunities</li>
          <li><strong>Clarity:</strong> Simple, practical frameworks your team can actually use</li>
          <li><strong>Partnership:</strong> I work alongside you—not from the sidelines</li>
          <li><strong>Results:</strong> We tie efforts to real business outcomes</li>
          <li><strong>Honesty:</strong> I give direct, respectful feedback—even when it’s uncomfortable</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Engagement Timeline</h2>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <strong>Immersion &amp; Insight</strong><br />
            I start by listening—closely. That means observing your product, customers, and team in motion to understand
            what’s working, what’s stuck, and where the real leverage lives.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Framework Co-Creation</strong><br />
            We develop clear, custom tools to guide decision-making—not one-size-fits-all templates, but frameworks that
            reflect your goals and constraints.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Action Planning</strong><br />
            We translate clarity into a focused, accountable roadmap—defining owners, timelines, and what success
            actually looks like.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Embedded Execution</strong><br />
            I work side by side with your team through the messy middle. No armchair advice—just sleeves-up support
            where it counts.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Continuous Calibration</strong><br />
            We check in regularly, adapt based on real-world feedback, and make sure momentum keeps building—not
            stalling.
          </li>
        </ol>

        <h2>What I Believe About Great Organizations</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Shared Wins &gt; Individual Credit:</strong> High-performing teams focus on collective progress, not heroics.</li>
          <li><strong>Clarity Is a Gift:</strong> Clear expectations and ownership drive speed and trust.</li>
          <li><strong>Feedback Is Fuel:</strong> Honest, consistent feedback improves outcomes and relationships.</li>
          <li><strong>Execution Builds Trust:</strong> Momentum matters. When teams follow through, trust grows.</li>
          <li><strong>Failure Is a Good Thing—If It’s Fast:</strong> Testing, learning, and iterating beats over-polishing every time.</li>
          <li><strong>Calm Is Contagious:</strong> The best leaders bring calm energy—even when things go sideways.</li>
          <li><strong>Be Close to the Work:</strong> Leaders who stay connected earn credibility and keep teams aligned.</li>
          <li><strong>AI Isn’t Optional—Embrace It:</strong> The best teams use AI to work smarter, faster, and with more focus. The rest fall behind.</li>
        </ul>
