        <h2>My Philosophy</h2>
        <p>The best strategies live in decisions, behaviors, and execution—not documents.</p>
        <p>
          I don’t believe in strategy for strategy’s sake. Every framework I use is grounded in
          real-world constraints and designed to drive momentum—with clear paths to action your team
          can follow.
        </p>
        <p>
          I focus on finding leverage—the 20% of effort that delivers 80% of the impact. That means
          ruthless prioritization, clear ownership, and systems that make progress visible and
          repeatable.
        </p>

          <li>
            <strong>Execution Builds Trust:</strong> Momentum matters. When teams follow through, trust grows.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Failure Is a Good Thing—If It’s Fast:</strong> Testing, learning, and iterating beats over-polishing every time.
          </li>
