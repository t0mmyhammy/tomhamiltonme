            <strong>Immersion &amp; Insight</strong>
            <br />
            I start by listening—closely. That means observing your product, customers, and team in motion to understand
            what’s working, what’s stuck, and where the real leverage lives.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Framework Co-Creation</strong>
            <br />
            We develop clear, custom tools to guide decision-making—not one-size-fits-all templates, but frameworks that
            reflect your goals and constraints.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Action Planning</strong>
            <br />
            We translate clarity into a focused, accountable roadmap—defining owners, timelines, and what success
            actually looks like.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Embedded Execution</strong>
            <br />
            I work side by side with your team through the messy middle. No armchair advice—just sleeves-up support
            where it counts.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Continuous Calibration</strong>
            <br />
            We check in regularly, adapt based on real-world feedback, and make sure momentum keeps building—not
            stalling.
