        <h2>My Philosophy</h2>
        <p>
          The best strategies emerge from the intersection of rigorous thinking and practical constraints. I don't
          believe in strategy for strategy's sake—every framework needs to translate into concrete actions your team can
          execute.
        </p>
        <p>
          I focus on finding leverage—the 20% of effort that drives 80% of results. That means ruthless prioritization,
          clear accountability, and transparent tracking of what's working.
        </p>
