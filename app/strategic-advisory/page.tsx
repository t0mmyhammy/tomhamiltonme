          <h2>What Makes This Different</h2>
          <p>
            Most consultants give you frameworks. I give you frameworks plus the operational support to implement them.
            Every engagement is designed around creating momentum, not just insights.
          </p>
          <p>
            Strategy is choice. It's what you say no to. If everyone on your team can't articulate the plan in plain
            English, it's not a real strategyâ€”it's just expensive planning.
          </p>

          <h2>Who I Work With</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>Founders scaling from product-market fit to growth</li>

            <li>Teams stuck between strategy and execution</li>

            <li>Leaders who want an advisor, not just a consultant</li>
