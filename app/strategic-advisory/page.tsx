        <p>
          Most consultants give you frameworks. I give you frameworks plus the operational support to implement them. Every engagement is built to create momentum, not just insights.
        </p>
        <p>
          Strategy is choice. It's what you say no to. If your team can't articulate the plan in plain English, it's just expensive planning.
