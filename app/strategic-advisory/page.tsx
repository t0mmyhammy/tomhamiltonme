        <h2>What Makes This Different</h2>
        <p>
          Most consultants drop a framework and disappear. I stay in it with
          you‚Äîhelping you translate insight into execution, and execution into
          outcomes.
        </p>
        <p>
          My work is designed to build momentum, not noise. That means fewer
          ‚Äúbig reveals‚Äù and more real-time progress. I pair strategic clarity
          with hands-on support‚Äîso your team can move faster, not just feel
          smarter.
        </p>
        <p>
          I also carve out time every week to stay sharp on what‚Äôs next‚Äîwhether
          that‚Äôs AI-powered workflows, automation tools, or new ways to reduce
          friction. You‚Äôll always get modern thinking and systems that scale.
        </p>

          <p>
            Strategy is about focus.
            <br />
            If your team can‚Äôt explain the plan in plain English‚Äîit‚Äôs not a
            strategy. It‚Äôs a delay.
          </p>
